        A healthy lifestyle is important for everyone. When we look after our
        physical health, we feel better too â€“ fitter, more relaxed and better
        able to cope with things. This is especially important when you have a
        mental illness.This means eating a balanced diet, getting regular
        exercise, avoiding tobacco and drugs and getting plenty of rest. Our
        bodies are like machines that require a balance of protein,
        carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, minerals and water to stay in good working
        order.
